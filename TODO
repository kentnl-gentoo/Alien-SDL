TODO list for Perl module Alien::SDL

- Win32 - prepare better prebuilt binaries
- MacOS - add any support (either source build or prebuilt binaries)
- Unix  - more testing needed (non-Linux platforms untested with the new v0.8.x)
- discuss automated CPAN Testers issues (and perhaps change build defaults somehow)

- [kmx] think of a complex t\alien_sdl_interface.t (we need this more in SDL_perl)
